She rode her mount, a sight to behold, Her banner aloft, her armor gold. The dinosaurs bent to her command, And peace settled over the icy land.

With the beasts as her guard, her loyal throng, She built her empire, both vast and strong. The Cryogenic Empire, it came to be known, A kingdom of ice, by a queen alone.",

Under his rule, the new Africa was a land of opportunity, where every survivor could find their place and purpose. It was a kingdom that mirrored the beauty and diversity of the Africa of old, yet it was unique, shaped by the will of a king who saw beyond the horizon.",

With his followers, Mars built the first city, naming it "Nova Roma". They established laws, built roads, arenas, and grand buildings reminiscent of ancient Rome. Mars, taking the title of "Caesar", led his people with wisdom and courage.",
